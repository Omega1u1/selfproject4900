## Description
This is a project for my final semester for CISC 4900. 
Where I want to work on a web program that would help with streamlining the tech support/inquiry ticketing process. With the intent of providing a user-friendly interface for submitting, tracking, and resolving support requests, improving efficiency for both users and support team(s)

## Technologies Used
I personally plan on hopefully making this a web based browser app.
Where I plan on using HTML, CSS, and possibly some Javascript for the front end development. While possibly using either Node.js or Vue.js for backend while possibly using SQL.

## Other Details
This is a project where it will be supervised under an Employee of KPMG under their business support services. (More info will be provided through out the course of this project)
